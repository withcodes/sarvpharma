                    pharmaceuticals products to acute care market operating in the
                    domestic & international market. Contract manufacturing seems to fit
                    neatly into the practice where businesses today focusing on what
                    they do best and leaving the rest to other . In addition to allowing

                <p>
                    We know that the success of contract manufacturing depends on the
                    mutual understanding between the contract manufacturer and the
                    customers. The former must know how to service the latter, and must
                    make clear his requirements (to the customer) in advance. The
                    relationship depends on mutual trust, and hence the communication
                    between the two parties must remain open. This will help both the
                    sides to understand the requirements of maintaining the partnership.

                    Contract manufacturing has undergone a tremendous change with the
                    transition from through-hole to surface-mount technology. New
                    material and new formulation techniques have been developed.
                    Consumer awareness and global competition has made it mandatory for
                    manufacturers to produce high-quality products at minimum cost
                    within the delivery schedule. In addition, a thorough understanding
                    of current manufacturing technologies is essential. Factors
                    important for achieving success in CM are product quality, cost
                    competitiveness, delivery schedule and Customer relationship.
